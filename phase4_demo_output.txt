PHASE 4 DEMO: Smart Execution Algorithms
============================================================
📋 Large Order: 10,000 shares of AAPL
   Side: BUY
   Reference price: $175.50
   Notional value: $1,755,000

⏰ TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) Execution:
   ✓ Split into 6 equal time slices
   Slice 1: 1,667 shares at 09:30
   Slice 2: 1,667 shares at 10:35
   Slice 3: 1,667 shares at 11:40
   ... and 3 more slices

📊 VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) Execution:
   ✓ Scheduled 6 volume-weighted slices
   Slice 1: 1,667 shares, 10.0% participation rate
   Slice 2: 1,667 shares, 10.0% participation rate
   Slice 3: 1,667 shares, 10.0% participation rate

⚡ Implementation Shortfall (Optimal Trade-off):
   ✓ Optimized 3 slices balancing impact vs. timing risk
   ✓ Total quantity scheduled: 10,000 shares

📅 Execution Timeline Comparison:
   TWAP:  Equal slices over trading day
   VWAP:  Volume-weighted slices (front-loaded during high volume)
   IS:    Optimized for minimal implementation shortfall

💰 Estimated Execution Costs:
   Spread cost: 5.0 bps
   Market impact: 0.4 bps
   Timing risk: 7.8 bps
   Total cost: 13.3 bps ($2,326)

============================================================
PHASE 4 DEMO: Latency Optimization & FIX Protocol
============================================================
🚀 Low-Latency Execution Infrastructure:
   FIX Protocol Enabled: False
   FIX Host: localhost:9878
   Sender CompID: CLIENT

📡 FIX Message Protocol:
   Order Request: 1000 AAPL @ $175.25
   ✓ FIX Message Type: D (New Order Single)
   ✓ Message contains 6 fields
   ✓ Message length: 81 bytes

⚡ Latency Benefits:
   • FIX Protocol: ~1-5ms order routing
   • REST API: ~20-100ms order routing
   • 4-20x latency improvement
   • Persistent connections eliminate handshake overhead
   • Binary messaging for minimal bandwidth

🔌 Connection Management:
   ✓ FIX Connector initialized
   • Automatic heartbeat management (30s intervals)
   • Session state tracking and recovery
   • Graceful fallback to REST when needed
   • Thread-safe message handling
   ℹ️  FIX disabled in config - would fallback to REST API
