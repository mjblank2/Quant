# Docker ignore file to prevent large or unnecessary files from being sent
# to the Docker build context. Without a .dockerignore, the entire
# repository (including test data and caches) is uploaded to the build
# process, which can exceed Render’s cache/extraction limits and lead to
# errors like `tar: Exiting with failure status` or missing content during
# COPY commands.

# Ignore everything by default. Specific entries will be re‑included below.

# Re‑include required application directories and files. Order matters:
!data/
!data_ingestion/
!features/
!models/
!ml/
!portfolio/
!tasks/
!scripts/
!alembic/
!jobs/

# Re‑include top‑level modules and configuration files.
!db.py
!config.py
!worker.py
!run_pipeline.py
!requirements.txt
!requirements.extra.txt
!alembic.ini

# Always ignore Git history, caches and other artifacts.
