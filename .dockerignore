# Docker ignore file to prevent large or unnecessary files from being sent
# to the Docker build context. Without a .dockerignore, the entire
# repository (including test data and caches) is uploaded to the build
# process, which can exceed Renderâ€™s cache extraction limits and cause
# errors like 'tar: Exiting with failure status' or missing content during
# copy commands.

# Ignore everything by default. Specific entries will be re-included below.

# Re-include required application directories and files. Order matters:
!data/
!data_ingestion/
!features/
!models/
!ml/
!portfolio/
!tasks/
!scripts/

!jobs/
!utils/

# Re-include top-level modules and configuration files.
!db.py
!config.py
!worker.py
!run_pipeline.py
!requirements.txt
!requirements.extra.txt
!utils_http.py
!utils_http_async.py
