Entry point for running the ingestion job as a oneâ€‘off.

This module reads the ``BACKFILL_DAYS`` environment variable (defaulting
to two years if unspecified) and invokes ``fetch_and_store`` from
``data_ingestion.main``.  It is intended to be used as the command
for worker and cron services in Render.
